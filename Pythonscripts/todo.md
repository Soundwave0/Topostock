1. Do the algorithm which will find the most alike topographical profile to match the stock
    1. Do this by choosing random coordinates then extracting data about the profile
    2. calculate the score of usefullness using mean square deviation then store all profiles which score below a certain threshold
    3. display the best and display the average of these profiles 
    4. Predict
    5. Implement in the main file for smooth usage on the front end
2. Improve upon this foundation by changing algorithms, calculate accuracy by running a few tests
3. Implement front end completely and make it interact with the python scripts
   1. Use the Flask framework and jinja to ask for user input and then run the script 
   2. Display the graph on the front page
   3.
